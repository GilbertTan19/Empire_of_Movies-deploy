        <h2 class="text-center"> Gathering around Movie and Discussion</h2>
        <p> Empire of Movies is all about movie and discussion as they are the heart of our website. These includes movies such as Film and TV-Series, as well as discussions about 
            how a film can progress and continue to the next sequels, how the characters develop throughout the movie, 
            how an actor/actress fits their character so much, and about fan theories or unresolved mysteries in the movie.
            Empire of Movies is a place where you can search or request movies you are interested in and 
            discuss about your favourite movies with other people. </p>
